* Internal Table with Header Line (Old Style)

TABLES: BEGIN itab01 OCCURS 0,

"where the names correspond

SELECT * from zemployees 
  INTO CORRESPONDING FIELDS OF TABLE itab01. 

"A different way of filling the table would be with the code below, this time with a select 
"loop filling each field one at a time, using the MOVE statement to move the data from one 
"tableâ€™s field to the other.

SELECT * FROM zemployees.
  MOVE zemployees-employee  TO itab01-employee,
  MOVE zemployees-surname   TO itab01-surname,
  MOVE zemployees-forename  TO itab01-forename,
  MOVE zemployees-title     TO itab01-title,

APPEND itab01. "if append is not added, the header record will simply get overwritten in each iteration of loop
ENDSELECT.


* Move-Corresponding

SELECT * FROM zemployees
  MOVE-CORRESPONDING zemployees to itab01. "you need to make sure that both fields have matching data types and lengths

  APPEND itab01.

* Filling Internal Tables with Work Area

 "refer to table definition in the second section (New Style Internal Table with Separate Work Area)

  INTO wa_itab02.
  APPEND wa_itab02 to itab02.

* Using Internal Tables One Line at a Time

LOOP AT itab01. "the header line is filled with data before being written to the output screen:
  WRITE: / itab01-surname, itab01-forename. 
ENDLOOP.


* Modify

LOOP AT itab01.
  IF itab01-surname = 'JONES'. "the MODIFY statement here will not create a brand new record, but will replace the existing JONES record in the table.
    itab01-surname = 'SMITH'.
    MODIFY itab01.
  ENDIF.
ENDLOOP.


* Describe and Insert

DESCRIBE TABLE itab01 LINES line_cnt. "This statement can be used to find out information about the content of an internal table, including the number of records the table holds, the reserve memory space used, and the type of table it is

INSERT itab01 INDEX line_cnt. "the APPEND statement automatically inserts the new record at the end of the table. If you want to add a record somewhere in the middle, the INSERT statement should be used. 


* Delete 

DELETE itab02 INDEX 5. "Note this only applies to standard and sorted tables as only these two types of tables have an index.

DELETE itab01 WHERE surname = 'SMITH'. "this can be combined with other logic to locate the record(s) which should be deleted
